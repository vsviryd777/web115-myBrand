<p>Every child is a whole world of emotions.
Our school will help discover talents and help find applications for them. We have a varied program and each child can try himself in different areas.</p>
<p>The school is designed for children from 3 to 18 years old. Where children will be engaged in different areas, art, STEM, chess, etc.</p>
<h3>UI/UX Design </h3>
<p><b>Colors</b></p>
<p>The main color I choose is  light blue (this is a symbol of stability and reliability)
  to attract the attention of parents and their children, I will use bright colors (yellow and orange)</p>
<p><b>UI Fundaments</b>
  <li>Simple design helping our users achieve their goals faster and more efficiently.</li>
<li>Consistency on the website help our users easily move from page to page and always know where they are.</li>

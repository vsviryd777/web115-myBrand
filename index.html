<p>“The cat has absolute emotional honesty: people, for one reason or another, can hide their feelings, but the cat cannot.” - Ernest Hemingway</p>
<p>If you live in Charlotte and are a cat person or want to learn more about them, we have collected valuable and exciting information on our website. Join our club.</p>
<p>My site is for those who love cats. The site will contain not only interesting information but also useful information for cat persons in our city of Charlotte.</p>
<h3>UI/UX Design </h3>
<p><b>Colors</b></p>
<p>The main color I choose is light blue (this is a symbol of stability and reliability). I will also add a dark blue color for contrast.
  To attract attention, I will use bright colors (yellow and orange)</p>
<p><b>Typography</b></p>  
<p>For headings, I will use "Sacramento", in italics. (For beauty)
  For the main text part I will use the font family: 'Merriweather', serif. (For ease of reading)</p>
<p><b>UI Fundaments</b>
  <li>Simple design helping our users achieve their goals faster and more efficiently.</li>
<li>Consistency on the website help our users easily move from page to page and always know where they are.</li>
